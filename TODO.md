# TODO Tasks

## Test Dataset Integration & Automation
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Pending
**Created**: April 2024

### Description
Create automated test cases and integration tests using the downloaded test datasets (Guerry and Iris). Tests should run through the web UI programmatically, simulating real user interactions while being executable from a single command.

### Datasets Available
1. `tests/data/guerry.csv`: Social indicators from 1830s France
   - Good for: correlation analysis, complex statistics, social science data
2. `tests/data/iris.csv`: Flower measurements dataset
   - Good for: basic statistics, classification, visualization

### Tasks
- [ ] Create automated test cases using both datasets
  - [ ] Set up Selenium/Playwright for web UI automation
  - [ ] Create test fixtures for automated data loading
  - [ ] Implement automated UI interaction tests
- [ ] Automate web application testing
  - [ ] File upload automation
  - [ ] Form submission automation
  - [ ] Results validation automation
- [ ] Create automated example analyses for documentation
  - [ ] Record test runs for documentation
  - [ ] Generate automated test reports
- [ ] Implement automated visualization tests
  - [ ] Screenshot comparison tests
  - [ ] Chart validation tests
- [ ] Automate statistical analysis feature testing
  - [ ] Batch test execution
  - [ ] Results validation

### Implementation Notes
- Datasets are located in `tests/data/`
- Download script available at `tests/download_test_data.py`
- All tests should be runnable with a single command (e.g., `python -m pytest tests/`)
- Consider implementing CI/CD pipeline integration
- Include automated regression testing
- Add test result reporting and visualization
- Tests should validate both UI elements and statistical results
